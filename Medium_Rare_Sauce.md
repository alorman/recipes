I also used this recipe, linked from the Reddit post https://diningbykelly.com/seared-filet-with-shallot-peppercorn-cream-sauce/

### Recipe

#### Ingredients
- 3 TB Unsalted Butter
- 1 Large or 2 Small Shallots, finely diced
- 2 tsp Black Peppercorns, crushed (or use a very fine grind setting or use white pepper)
- 2 Cloves Garlic, minced
- 5 TB All-Purpose Flour
- 2 tsp Dijon Mustard
- 1 TB Worcestershire Sauce
- 3 cups Chicken Stock (for a darker look, use beef stock, but chicken will have a better flavor)
- 1/2 cup Heavy Cream
- Kosher Salt
- Approx 1/3 lb frozen chicken livers
- Approx 1 Tbsp soy sauce
- Approx 1 Tbsp fish sauce
- Approx 1 Tbsp Worcestershire Sauce 
- Approx 1/2 Tbsp balsamic vinegar

#### Process
- Defrost livers if frozen
- Melt butter in a large sauté pan on medium-low heat.
- Add in shallots, season with salt, and cook down until soft.
- Add in garlic and crushed peppercorns and sauté for another 2 minutes **Avoid letting this get too dry and burning the garlic**.
- Stir in dijon, Worcestershire, and flour for a minute and then pour in chicken stock.
- Bring to a boil and then slightly lower the heat and simmer uncovered for 10 minutes.
- As sauce cooks, cook chicken livers over medium-high heat in a separate pan with approx 2 tbsp of butter in the pan. Cook livers until they have an excellent brown and are cooked to approximately medium 
- Once the sauce has reduced after 10 minutes, pour in the cream and simmer again uncovered for 5 minutes.
- Roughly chop livers then add to saucepan.
- Use stick, or high powered blender to blend sauce in saucepan until all livers are completely blended
- At this point the sauce will be a bit lighter than Medium Rare's, but will coalesce somewhat more easily than theirs. 
- **Proceed Carefully** This will now convert the sauce into having the vinegar-y bite of Medium Rare's. If you like the sauce as-is, stop.
- Add the fish sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce and Worcestershire sauce to the pan or blender and mix to taste.

- Season with salt to taste and serve hot.

- Sauce will keep for approximately 1 week in the refrigerator and is easy to reheat without breaking.
