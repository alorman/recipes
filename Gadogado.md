# GadoGado (Indonesian Salad with Peanut Dressing)

Adapted from unknown sources by AWE

## Ingredients:

- 2 medium new potatoes ( red ones add a nice colour)
- 3 eggs
- 1 very small cabbage OR a small chinese cabbage
- ¼ lb fresh green string beans
- 1 large carrot
- a cauliflower  ---- for 5 ounces ( frozen will work)
- ¼ lb fresh bean sprouts
- 1 small English cucumber ( cut a large one in half if necessary).
- 1 lb roasted peanuts **OR** smooth good quality peanut butter
- 1 fresh garlic bulb
- 3 medium shallots
- walnut or grapeseed oil
- dark brown sugar
- 1 lemon OR 1 lime for juice & zest  
- chili flakes
- optional: 
  - puffed shrimp crackers
  - 1 kaffir lime leaf 

## Method:

- Wash the potatoes (it is not necessary to peel them) and put them on to boil.

- Cook for 6-8 minutes until fork tender, but not falling a part.  NOW peel them, and cut into ¼” thick slices. Cool to room temp.

- Hard boil the eggs for 12 mins in boiling water. Peel and slice into quarters.

- Keeping all the vegetables separate as you are preparing them:
  - Trim the beans and cut into 2” length.
  - Trim and peel the carrots, then cut them into crosswise 2” segments.
  - Cut the cauliflower into small florets.
  - Remove the tough outer leaves of the cabbage, core it & cut into long thin shreds.
  - Rinse the bean sprouts well in a bowl of cool water.
  - Drain well.
  - Peel the cuke and slice into round slices.

- Set a bowl near the stove with the sieve on over it. Also set out several plates to 
hold the veg as they cook.  

- Bring 2 quarts of water in a big pot to a good boil. Add tsps. of salt and stir. 

- Put the green beans in and the carrots in the boiling water, boil for 3 minutes, until
just tender. Empty the pot into the sieve ( keep the hot water). Drain the veg and rinse with cold water. Set on a plate.  

- Pour the reserved hot water back into the pot and bring to a boil again. Boil the cauliflower for 1 ½ minutes . Again, empty the contents of the pot over the sieve and rinse the cauliflower well with cool water. Place on a plate.

- Repeat the same process with the bean sprouts ( cook for only 30 seconds, & this can be done in the microwave for 1 min.)  and the cabbage for 1 minute. 

- Refresh both with cool water and squeeze dry in a towel. Place them on plates.

- To make the peanut sauce:
  - Shake the excess salt from your roasted peanuts Put them in a processor, whizz as finely as possible . ( Alternatively, a good quality peanut butter can be used just as well here). 
  
  - Peel and mince the garlic and shallots. Put a small frying pan with a little oil in it to medium heat. When hot, add the garlic and shallots, stir and fry for about 1 minute until both are a deep golden brown. 

  - Put 2 cups of water ( the veg water is good, as it now has a nice flavour) , the good pinch of chili flakes, ½ tsp salt, 2 tspns of the brown sugar and the ground peanuts/peanut butter.  
  
  - Stir well and bring to a boil, simmer for 15-20 minutes until it is no thicker than a ranch salad dressing.

  - Add the pepper, and the lime juice. Taste for preference. 

  - Arrange the vegetables nicely on  4 plates or a big platter.
  
  - If using the individual plates, drizzle the dressing over the veg and have a pot of the reserved dressing as extra.

  - If using the platter, have the peanut sauce for diners to add to their own plates.

- Serve shrimp crackers on the side.

An option I like: add a ¼ c. lite coconut milk to the peanut sauce and zest from the lime,
or if you have them, a very finely minced kaffir lime leaf.
