### Recipe

#### Ingredients
- 3 TB Unsalted Butter
- 1 Shallot, finely diced
- 2 tsp Black Peppercorns, crushed (either use a very fine grind setting or use white pepper)
- 2 Cloves Garlic, minced
- 3 TB AP Flour
- 1 tsp Dijon Mustard
- 1 TB Worcestershire Sauce
- 3 cups Chicken Stock (for a darker look, use beef stock, but chicken will have a better flavor)
- 1/2 cup Heavy Cream
- Kosher Salt
- Approx 1/4 lb frozen chicken livers
- Approx 2 Tbsp soy sauce
- Approx 1 tsp fish sauce
- Approx 2 tsp apple cider or balsamic vinegar

#### Process
- Defrost livers if frozen
- Melt butter in a large sauté pan on medium-low heat.
- Add in shallots, season with salt, and cook down until soft.
- Add in garlic and crushed peppercorns and sauté for another 2 mins.
- Stir in dijon, Worcestershire, and flour for a minute and then pour in chicken stock.
- Bring to a boil and then slightly lower the heat and simmer uncovered for 10 minutes.
- As sauce cooks, cook chicken livers over medium heat in a separate pan with approx 2 tbsp of butter in the pan. Cook livers until they have an excellent brown and are cooked to approximately medium 
- Once the sauce has reduced after 10 minutes, pour in the cream and simmer again uncovered for 5 minutes.
- Roughly chop livers then add to saucepan.
- Use stick blender to blend sauce in saucepan until all livers are completely blended

- At this point the sauce will be a bit lighter than Medium Rare's, but will coalesece somewhat better than theirs. 
- Add the 2 Tbsp of soy sauce and dashes of fish sauce to the sauce and stir. 
- For an extra kick, add the balsamic vinegar, a little at a time, to taste. 

- Season with salt to taste and serve hot.

- Sauce will keep for approxiately 1 week in the refrgigerator and is easy to reheat without breaking.
