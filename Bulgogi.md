# Bulgogi

A traditional Korean dish adapted by AWE

## Ingredients:

- A lean skirt, flat-iron, or flank steak ( 1-1 ½ lbs) 
- 1 bunch scallions
- 1 nicely ripened bartlett pear --- 2 if you desire
- 1 head garlic
- 1 jar toasted sesame seeds
- Sesame oil
- Rice wine vinegar
- Grapeseed or peanut oil
- light brown sugar.
- Low sodium soy sauce
- Sesame oil
- fresh pepper
- 1” knob fresh ginger
- Chili-garlic sauce (Sriracha Garlic with the red lid) 
- Japanese rice
- Kimchee
- 1 head soft Boston lettuce

## Method:

- Slice any hard exterior fat off the steak, then criss-cross score it on both sides,
set aside.

- Peel & finely chop 5-8 cloves of  garlic and the ginger

- Roughly whizz the sesame seeds in a processor or mortar & pestle  ( it should look like rough sawdust, not peanut butter) 

- Wash, core and dice ( ½”) the pear. Not necessary to peel.

- Clean and finely slice the scallions.

- Mix the chopped pear, scallion, ginger, garlic in a bowl or cup.

- In a big glass measuring cup mix:
  - ¼ c. peanut oil, 
  - ½ cup soy sauce, 
  - ¼ c. Aji-Mirin, 
  - 2 Tblsp rice wine vinegar
  - ¼ c. sesame oil
  - 1 tsp salt
  - 2 Tablespoons fresh ground pepper
  - 2 Tablespoons Chili garlic paste
  - 1 Tblsp light brown sugar
  - The 1 c. ground sesame seeds

- Whisk this together, add the scallion-pear-garlic mixture, then pour into
a heavy freezer weight zip lock bag. Now put the steak into the bag and
zip shut. Massage bag to get all ingredients well mixed around meat.
Refrigerate for at least 30 mins ( overnight is fine too).

- About 30 mins before you start to grill put your rice on to cook in rice cooker as normal.

- Get your grill nice and hot---grill pan works well too.

- Shake the meat free of the bits and juices, slap it on the grill. **Keep the contents of the bag!!** If in a grill pan, do it in two portions, don’t crowd it.

- You want the outside to be well grilled and a little caramelised, while the 
inside should be medium rare. ( This is one case where rare isn’t better---the steak is tough if undercooked.)

- Meanwhile, pour the remains of the marinade into a bowl and either microwave for 3-5 minutes or simmer on the stove till bubbling. You want to be sure the garlic and ginger bits are cooked well.  

- Slice the steak into slivers and serve with rice , lettuce cups, kimchee & the sauce.
Have extra chili garlic sauce to add as diners desire.
