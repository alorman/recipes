#  Kohlrabi Salad

Transcribed from Mahdur Jaffry and lightly adapted by AWE

## Ingredients:

- 2 large kohlrabi ( purple or pale green). ½--3/4  lbs
- 1 large carrot
- Rice vinegar
- sugar
- red chili  flakes
- fresh mint leaves
- fresh cilantro leaves
- 1 green chili
- roasted peanuts ( unsalted, if possible. If not possible, wash peanuts thoroughly under water before use)

## Method:

- Peel the kohlrabi and slice it lengthwise into 1/8” slices. Kohlrabi is very tough, take care!

- Stacking a few slices together, cut slices lengthwise into julienne strips.

- Peel the carrot, halve it lengthwise and then cut it crosswise into ½” segments , which should be more or less the size of the julienned kohlrabi.

- Put the kohlrabi and carrot into a bowl or plastic colander. Add 1 tsp of
salt and toss thoroughly with  your hands. Set aside for 10-15 minutes.

- Then, give them a quick rinse with cool water and squeeze out as much
moisture as you can. (wrapping in a cloth tea towel, then squeezing out the 
excess water is a good method).

- In a glass jar or cup mix :
  - ¼ c. of the vinegar
  - 4 tsps. of sugar ( 3 tsps. real maple syrup is a less-sweet alternative)
  - a pinch chili flakes
  
- stir well then nuke for about 20 seconds so sugar dissolves well.

- Add to the vinegar mixture:
  - 10-12  finely shredded mint leaves &  2-3 Tblsp chopped cilantro leaves and the finely chopped green chili

- Toss this into the kohlrabi and carrot.

- Toss well

- Top with ½ c. chopped peanuts
