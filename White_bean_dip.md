An AWE original

- low sodium chicken broth
- s + p
- chili flakes
- fresh flat leaf parsley

## Method:

- Peel and finely chop 4-5 cloves of garlic.

- Pour 2-3 Tblsp of olive oil in a pan, warm it up and add the garlic.

- Slowly, on low heat, bring the garlic to just slightly golden colour.

- Open the cans of beans and drain, but don’t rinse.

- Pour beans into the pan along with about ½ cup of the chicken broth.

- Simmer on low till bubbling a little. 

- Add chili flakes, S+P to taste.

- Take your potato masher and roughly mash the beans.

- Add the parsley and more chicken broth if needed.

- You want it in a spread-like consistency-----like soft, but slightly lumpy, mashed potatoes.

- Put into a serving dish a drizzle a thread of olive oil on top if desired.

- For Soup Option:

  - Proceed as above, but add more chicken broth to make it soupy. Add a couple handfuls of washed, roughly chopped greens like baby kale, Tuscan kale, or arugula. And a ¼ c. roughly chopped hot Italian sausage ( pre cooked), if desired.  Simmer well, adding more broth as required.
