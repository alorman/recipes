### Sources
This is a fork of https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/food/wp/2016/05/10/homemade-bagel-recipe-how-to-make-the-best-bagels-at-home/ which did all the research and testing to arrive at this. Their recipe is awesome. Thanks!

### Notes
You really do want a scale for this. Measuring is important.  

I used thermal tiles like these: https://www.amazon.com/Outset-76176-Pizza-Grill-Stone/dp/B00JUIO9VY/ref=sr_1_5?crid=EOLF87NS87XR&keywords=pizza+tile&qid=1696870423&sprefix=pizza+tile%2Caps%2C107&sr=8-5 in my oven  

I also used a cast iron pan in my oven to add thermal mass, just make sure it's clean before putting it the oven.   

### Recipe

#### Ingredients
For Bagels:  
- 3 grams instant dry yeast, making sure that the yeast is alive. You want **vigorous bubbles** when proofing.  
- 337 grams warm tap water (80 degrees)  
- 623 grams 13% protein bread flour
- 2 teaspoons salt  
- 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon barley malt syrup, molasses or honey (be careful with the honey)
- 3 tablespoons cornmeal, for dusting

Bagel Toppings (this is all about you):
- Poppy seeds
- "Everything but the bagel" topping
- Onion flakes
- Whatever you want, really

#### Process
#### The night before you want bagels
- Mix the yeast into the 80 degree water in a small bowl or measuring cup and let it start to **vigorously** foam while you prepare the rest of the dough. (If the mixture fails to foam after several minutes, dump it out and start over with new yeast.)

- Combine the flour, salt and barley malt (or molasses) syrup in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough-hook attachment. Add the yeast mixture and beat on the lowest speed until the dough starts to come together around the dough hook, about 4 minutes. Increase the speed to medium-low; beat for 7 to 10 minutes or until the dough is cohesive, smooth and stiff.

- Dust a rimmed baking sheet (or even better; silpat sheet) with the cornmeal. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface, then divide it into balls of about 4 ounces each. Roll and shape the pieces into smooth balls by pushing it into itself ([Babish has a great tutorial on how to do this](https://youtu.be/vWdjqdmFHxw?si=gZl9prZwSI7BfLe4&t=168) and cover with plastic wrap to rest at room temperature for 5 minutes.

- Form each dough ball into a rope 11 inches long by rolling it under your palms. Try to avoid tapering the ends of the rope by rolling the center thinner.

- Shape each rope into a circle with a diameter of about 4 inches, overlapping the ends by about 1-1/2 inches. Pinch the overlapped areas firmly together, moistening them lightly with water if the ends won’t stick. Each ring should be about the same thickness all around; if it’s not, you can roll it in other places around the ring to even it out.

- Place the dough rings on the cornmeal-covered baking sheet as you work, spaced an inch or two apart. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight to rise. The rings will have puffed and spread slightly.

#### The next morning
- When you’re ready to boil and bake the bagels, place the pizza tiles or stone and the case iron pan, if using, on the middle oven rack. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees. (The longer you can preheat, the better; up to an hour is great.)

- While the oven is preheating fill a large wide pot or dutch oven with 3 inches of water; bring it to a boil over high heat.

- If using the toppings (and you should be), spread them out on a plate or pan and be ready to put the wet and hot bagel rings into it.

- Drop 1 to 3 dough rings into the boiling water, not allowing them to touch stirring and briefly submerging them with a metal skimmer or slotted spoon, until very slightly puffed, 30 to 35 seconds. Transfer the dough rings to a wire rack, bottom (flatter) sides down, to drain. Repeat with the remaining rings.

- Dip one side of the bagel into the topping then retrieve and place, topping side up, on a baking sheet.

- Transfer bagels quickly to the pizza tiles/stone. Use a spatula; or optionally use a sheet of parchment to make transferring easier. Avoid keeping the oven open too long. 

- Bake on the upper rack for 12 to 18 minutes or until the bagels are a deep golden brown and crisp, rotating the parchment paper or rotating the bagel positions,  the baking time will depend on whether you’re using a stone and the heat capacity of your oven.

- Use a spatula to transfer the bagels to a wire rack to cool. If you’ve split the bagels into two batches, slide the second one in and bake.

- Wait for a few minutes before splitting open the hot bagels then add whitefish salad.
