# Tuna and Walnut Pasta

Adapted by AWE from Harlanne Papanek

## Ingredients:
- 2   bunches flat leaf parsley
- 1   bunch scallions
- 1   bag walnut halves and pieces 
- 1   lb. box linguine or fettuccine
- 2   cans tuna in olive oil (not in water)
- Dried chili flakes
- olive oil-- a nicely flavored one
- Parmesan cheese
- s + p

## METHOD:

- cook pasta 2 minutes less than package directions for al dente, in heavily salted water. Break pasta in half as you put it into the pot (this will allow it to cling to the other ingredients better). 

- rinse in cool water, OR air cool, drain very well. Set aside. 

- Wash parsley & scallions. Chop scallions into small rounds.

- Chop 1 cup of the walnuts ( freeze the rest for later use) 

- Coarsely chop parsley 

- Combine all in a large bowl.

- Lightly drain tuna and add to bowl

- Add a glug or two of olive oil ( 3-6 TBSP)

- Mix well with hands or salad utensils.

- Add about ¾ of the pasta and toss well.

- Add ¼ c. parmesan cheese & 2 tsps chili flakes toss well. Add a little glug of olive oil if you want, to make it just a little slippery ( which is traditional).

- Add S & P to taste.

- Serve with parmesan on the side to add if desired. 

#### Options:  
Add a handful of halved cherry tomatoes , and /or a handful of drained, well rinsed capers.
