# Thanksgiving Cranberry Sauce

## Ingredients
2 bags cranberries----wash well.
2 or 3 tangerines, or oranges ( if you you clementines, use 4-5)
Sugar - ~1 cup. depending on sweetness of oranges.
pinch salt

## Method
- Wash the citrus with a good scrub of soap and water.
- If they are too seedy, remove the center pithy part and the seeds. (That’s why I like the clementines—they are sweeter &  have no seeds)
- Slice into rough chunks.
- Throw cranberries into the food processor and whiz till it looks like chunky granola. remove to a bowl (do not use blender).
- Throw citrus into processor and whiz till quite pulverized into small lumps.
- Add the cranberries and whiz till the desired texture.
- Add the pinch of salt and most of the sugar.
- Pour into a bowl, cover and place in a reasonably cool place.
- When ready to use, taste for sweetness, add remaining sugar if desired
