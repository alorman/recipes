# Asian Chicken and Cucumbers

An AWE original dish

## Ingredients:

- 2   boneless, skinless chicken breasts. ( aim for free-range; they tend to be less watery, which   does make a difference in this dish).
- 2   English cukes, the long skinny kind in shrink-wrap.
- 2   heads of garlic ( for 10 cloves )
- 1   1” knob of fresh ginger
- 1  jar of garlic chili paste OR
- 5  dried chilies
- 1  bunch of scallions 
- sugar
- corn-starch
- 1 egg white
- Peanut or grapeseed oil
- Sesame oil
- Rice vinegar
- Aji-Mirin, sake or dry sherry
- lite soy sauce
- japanese rice

## Method:

- Start rice in rice cooker 

- You will need a wok or large sauté pan. 

- Peel, then chop ginger and garlic into match-head sized pieces. Set aside.  

- Clean & slice all the scallions, using as much of the green part as possible, & divide into two mounds: ¾ & ¼ 

- Cut the chicken into bite size pieces & place in a bowl.  Add the ¾ pile of scallion to chicken.

- In a bowl add:
  - 3 Tbsp soy sauce, 
  - 2 Tblsp sesame oil, 
  - 2 Tblspn aji mirin, 
  - 2 tsp sugar, 
  - ½  tsp salt, 
  - 1 egg white 
  - 1 Tblsp cornstarch.  
  
- Stir well,  cover and let sit for up to 4 hours ( refrigerated).

- About a  half hour before cooking---start your rice now ---- wash and thinly slice the cukes ( Peel if skin seems leathery). Toss in non-reactive colander with 1 tsp salt. Let sit for 15-- 30 minutes.

- When cukes are ready, rinse in cool water and pat dry.
Heat your wok till a drop of water bounces and fizzles away. Add a Tbsp of oil, heat till it shimmers, then add the cukes.  

- Toss fry for up to 2 minutes or until they’ve just begun to go limp. Remove to a bowl. Turn off heat. Wipe out wok or pan. 

- Add 1 Tbsp water to chicken mixture and stir well.

- Heat remaining oil till shimmering. Add garlic, ginger and chili paste and stir fry for about 30 seconds.  Turn down heat a little bit and add chicken mixture . Stir fry, but allow chicken to cook well .  This should take about 2 minutes. Slice open a piece of chicken with your wok shovel and check for doneness---at this point it should be slightly pink.

- Add the cukes, and continue to stir fry for 30 seconds. Splash about 2 tsp of soy sauce on just before serving. Garnish with a sliced scallion if desired.

- Serve with rice. This dish can also be made successfully with pork (tenderloin)
for a change of things; follow the guidelines for chicken, above.
