# Working Girl's Pasta

Adapted from Jamie Oliver

## Ingredients:

- 2 cans good quality tuna in olive oil. Cento is a  good brand. ( do not be tempted to make this dish with tuna packed in water---it tastes metallic)
- olive oil
- 1 lemon
- capers
- fresh basil
- 1 lb penne pasta
- anchovies in oil
- 1 head of garlic
- capers
- black pitted olives--pref. Nicoise style from an olive bar.
- dried chili flakes
- 2 handfuls---or one plastic carton---really ripe tomatoes ( those Italian plum toms. work best)
- flat leaf parsley
- white wine , optional.
- Grated or shredded Parmesan or Reggiano

## Method:

- Peel and mince garlic. Zest and juice the lemon. Roughly chop the olives & put the capers in a bowl of cold water.  Wash and roughly chop the tomatoes.

- Smash the basil to a pulp in a mortar & pestle ( or on a plate using the back of a big spoon), add a pinch of salt and pepper. Add the zest and juice of the lemon and a couple of Tblspns of olive oil. Mix this with the two cans of tuna in a bowl.

- Get your water going for the pasta and follow package directions for al dente.

- As soon as you put the pasta **14 oz., not the whole pound** in the boiling water, get your big skillet warmed up to  lo-medium. Add a glug or two of olive oil,  turn heat to low and add the anchovies. Let anchovies sort of melt, stirring them into the oil.   

- Drain the capers well, add them and the minced garlic, olives and chili flakes to the anchovies. 

- Stir around for a couple of minutes on lowest heat, till the garlic softens. Add the chopped tomatoes, a little swig of the white wine if using and the tuna. 

- Simmer on low for about 5 minutes; donâ€™t over cook the tuna so it gets tough. It should be sort of soft and silky. 

- Pasta should now be ready, drain and reserve some of the cooking water.  Toss the hot pasta with the hot tuna sauce, add the chopped parsley and toss again. You may need a little more olive oil and a spoonful of the cooking water to make the sauce a little soupy.

-Serve with grated Parmesan.
