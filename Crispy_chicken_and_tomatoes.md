# Crisypy Chicken Legs and Sweet Tomatoes

From Jamie Oliver

## Ingredients
- 4 Chicken Legs, thighs and legs

- Big bunch fresh basil ( two of those cellophane bionic bunches or two of the plastic clamshell containers)

- 2 containers of mixed cherry tomatoes: red & yellow

- 3-5 large plum tomatoes

- olive oil

- 1 whole garlic bulb

## Method:

- Preheat the oven to 350.

- Roughly chop or tear the basil, keeping the stalks.

- Break the garlic up into individual cloves ( should have around 8) but don’t peel them.

- Half the smaller tomatoes, quarter the larger ones.

- Joint the chicken legs into thigh and leg pieces. Season all over with s + p.  Place them in a snug fitting roasting pan in one layer.

- Throw in all the basil, stalks and all. Chuck in all the tomatoes. Scatter the garlic cloves into the pan along with the chili flakes. 

- Tuck some of the tomatoes and garlics under the chicken pieces.

- Drizzle some olive oil over the top of the chicken. 

- Place in the oven and cook for 1 ½ hrs, turning the tomatoes half way through, until the chicken is crisp and sort of falling off the bone. 

- Squeeze the now soft garlic cloves over the top of the dish before serving ( discard their papery shells)

- This dish is great with steamed new potatoes, or linguine.

- It is fantastic served with a white bean puree ( a la mashed potato) as in the recipe for white beans, above. 

- A light lettuce salad completes the meal.
